# Cypress Automation Project [agibank_test]

This project contains automated web testing using Cypress.
_______

## Technical Choices

I decided to use Cypress because it is suitable for end-to-end testing of web applications. It can simulate user interactions on multiple pages and test the application's behavior as a whole.
In addition, cypress has a low learning curve, is one of the most requested tools in companies, has an active community.
